#  Sales_SQL Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an end-to-end SQL analysis on a pizza sales dataset to uncover actionable business insights from transactional data.

Using SQL, we analyze sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and revenue trends. The project simulates real-world business intelligence tasks by transforming raw data into key performance indicators (KPIs) that support data-driven decision-making.
